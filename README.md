##📸 Face Detection using OpenCV

###🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using computer vision techniques implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. It utilizes OpenCV’s powerful tools to detect human faces from images or video input (e.g., webcam or uploaded images).

###📁 Files in the Repo

face-detection.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook containing the face detection code and explanations.

README.md – Project overview and usage guide.

###🧠 Technologies Used
Python 3

Jupyter Notebook

OpenCV (cv2)

NumPy

###⚙️ How It Works
Loads image/video input.

Converts frames to grayscale.

Uses a Haar Cascade classifier (or equivalent) to detect faces.

Draws bounding boxes around detected faces.
