## ðŸ“¸  Face Detection using OpenCV

### Overview

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using computer vision techniques. It uses the **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once)** object detection model from the Ultralytics library. The model is trained and evaluated using a custom dataset obtained via **Roboflow** . It detects human faces from images (e.g. uploaded images).

### Files in the Repo

face-detection.ipynb â€“ Notebook containing the face detection code.

README.md â€“ Project overview and usage guide.

### Features

- Custom dataset download and setup from Roboflow
- Training a YOLOv8 model on the dataset
- Evaluation of model performance
- Visualization of predictions on validation images
- Draws bounding boxes around detected faces.

### Technologies Used
- Python 3

- Kaggle Notebook

- [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/)

- OpenCV

- IPython display for showing predictions
