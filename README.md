## 📸  Face Detection using OpenCV

### 🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using computer vision techniques. It uses the **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once)** object detection model from the Ultralytics library. The model is trained and evaluated using a custom dataset obtained via **Roboflow** . It detects human faces from images (e.g. uploaded images).

### 📁 Files in the Repo

face-detection.ipynb – Notebook containing the face detection code.

README.md – Project overview and usage guide.

### ✨ Features

- Custom dataset download and setup from Roboflow
- Training a YOLOv8 model on the dataset
- Evaluation of model performance 📊
- Visualization of predictions on validation images
- Draws bounding boxes around detected faces.

### 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python 3

- Kaggle Notebook

- [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/)

- OpenCV

- IPython display for showing predictions
